triangulate

I used this project to create the low-poly image on codepen.

I does some simple local optimization.

It seems to do quite a good job compared to some of the apps that i have seen on the android store.

Possible improvements:

* Add and remove points.
* Calculate an optimised gradiant for a selected triangle.
* More optimization options.
* Zooming in and zooming out option.
* Import and Export option.
* Better UI design.
* Faster delaunay algorithm.
* Parallelization of the algoritm.
